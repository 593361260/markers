[Description]

Markers is a simple, multitouch, pressure-sensitive drawing app that’s perfect for phones and tablets.

☛ Pressure sensitivity that works with most Android devices, even without a stylus. (But if you have a stylus, it works great with that too.)

☛ Multitouch: two fingers make two lines, three make three, and so on—up to the limits of your device (typically 5 simultaneous touches for phones and 10 for tablets.

☛ Kid-friendly interface: Every pen size and color is on-screen; multitouch drawing means accidental touches (such as kid hands on the edges of the display) won't prevent any little fingers from painting.

☛ Plays well with others: share your drawings to other apps, and share images into Markers to draw on top of them.
